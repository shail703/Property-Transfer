# Property-Transfer

A distrubuted web application for property transfer using Blockchain Technology

--> Currently we are using the central authority(Government) to transfer the property ownership. This makes it time consuming
    and attracts a lot of extra expenses too with an additional burden of document management. Also, since
    the system is centralized, there is always a possibility of fraudulent. 
    
--> By using this technology which uses distributed ledgers. If we use blockchain to record land transfers, we can have an immutable history of
    every property transaction that can be viewed by everyone and tampered by no one!!!
    
--> This brings us to a point that how the government will play its role when people shall try to transfer the
    property on their own? Here govt can initiate this service as a part of e-governance & cut down delays
    
Actions to be performed :

  1) Any address can send the property from his account to other owner.  
  2) Only the system(Government) authorized account can allocate the property.
